Hi there, I'm Rajesh. According to the Myers-Briggs test, I'm a [Logician (INTP-T)](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality). I just love pondering the mysteries of the universe, trying to figure out how things work inside. Along the way, I fell in love with computers and coding. While studying for my Master's during the day, I spent my nights learning to code. What I discovered is that I really enjoy solving problems.

As [Eric](https://twitter.com/esrtweet) said in his article about [How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html), I believe that the world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved. Each challenge presents an opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to making our world a better place. Whether it's mastering a new programming language, designing innovative solutions, or tackling complex issues, the thrill of overcoming obstacles drives me forward. By embracing curiosity and creativity, I am committed to exploring new frontiers and making meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving landscape of technology and beyond.

I hold a Master's degree in Physics, where I delved into the fascinating realms of quantum mechanics, relativity, and beyond. My academic journey instilled in me a deep appreciation for the underlying principles that govern the universe, as well as a strong foundation in mathematical modeling and critical thinking.

Despite my background in physics, my career path led me into the realm of software development. Over the past two years, I've immersed myself in the world of coding, honing my skills in languages such as Python and gaining hands-on experience in various projects and domains. From developing robust applications to troubleshooting complex bugs, I thrive in the fast-paced, ever-evolving landscape of technology.

Outside of the digital realm, I have a diverse range of hobbies that keep me grounded and inspired. Lately, I have been taking an interest in exploring the etymologies of words. For instance, the word "movie" comes from the phrase "moving picture." In the early days of film, the technology was often referred to as "moving pictures" because it created the illusion of motion by displaying still frames in rapid succession. By the 1910s, the term "moving picture" was shortened to "movie picture" and eventually just "movie." The first known usage of the word "movie" to refer to motion pictures was in 1912, though it likely emerged in slang a few years earlier. Interestingly, a competing term for motion pictures in the early 1900s was "photoplay." This described how these films were a form of visual play or theatre captured on photos. But over time, "movie" became the favoured term, probably because it was quicker and simpler to say.

I also enjoy exchanging digital letters with my pen pels through [Slowly](https://slowly.app/). This platform tries to simulate the experience of traditional pen pal experience in a modern way. Reading their letters allow me to instantly teleport to different world. I try to paint a picture as I read through those words.

If I am allowed to recommend you only one video that I am truly fascinated by, then it would be [The Art of Code by Dylan Beattie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U).

If you share my enthusiasm for unraveling the mysteries of the universe or simply want to connect over a shared interest, I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to reach out, and let's embark on this journey together.
